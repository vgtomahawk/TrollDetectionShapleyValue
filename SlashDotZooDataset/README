README for the DAI-Labor Slashdot Zoo dataset.

Please send comments, errors, etc. to jerome.kunegis@dai-labor.de


---------
Summary
---------

The Slashdot Zoo is the social network of technology news website
Slashdot (http://slashdot.org/).  It consists of 510,000 relationships
among 78,000 users.  

Relationships can be positive ("friend") or negative ("foe").  The
network is directed, i.e. A having B as friend does not imply B having A
as friend; some inverse relationships may even be "skewed".  

In addition to the dataset itself, we provide test and training data for
troll classification and link prediction as described in the following
paper: 

The Slashdot Zoo:  Mining a Social Network with Negative Edges.  Jerome
Kunegis, Andreas Lommatzsch, and Christian Bauckhage.  In Proceedings of
the International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 741--750, 2009.

Files

out.corpus -- Full dataset

  Each line represents one endorsement.  
  
  Format:   
    UserA UserB +		UserA marked UserB as a friend
    UserA UserB - 		UserA marked UserB as a foe

  Usernames are URL-encoded (e.g. "%24" instead of "$" and spaces
  replaced by "+")

out.matrix -- Full dataset (numeric)

  The same information as "out.corpus" but numeric.  Users are
  represented by continuous IDs ranging from 1 to 71523.  The
  relationship type (friend/foe) is represented as +1 and -1.  This file
  can be read by Matlab. 

out.userids -- Mapping between usernames and IDs

  Usernames are not URL-encoded.

	
--------------------------------
Files for troll classification
--------------------------------

out.trolls -- List of trolls

  The user IDs of troll users.  Used as the test set for troll
  prediction.  These users are the foes of user No More Trolls.  

out.matrix.clean -- Training set for troll classification

  The dataset without the foe-links of user No More Trolls, in the same
  format as "out.matrix". 


--------------------------
Files for link prediction
--------------------------

out.test -- Test set

  A 30% subset of all links, used as the test set.  In the same format
  and using the same user IDs as "out.matrix".  

out.training -- Training set

  The remaining 70% of the dataset, in the same format and using the
  same user IDs as "out.matrix".
